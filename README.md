## Project with InterSystems IRIS + Newman to test Apis and get an html report


##Â How it works

# Add some test to your collection (In this example I'm adding a global test for the collection that checks the header response code)



# Export your collection in json format

# Start docker file and access

Start the docker-compose file and access to the url 
http://localhost:52773/csp/user/index.html

# Drop the exported collection and press the "Run test" button


# You'll be automatically redirected to the report page
